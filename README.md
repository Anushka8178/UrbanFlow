# UrbanFlow - Smart City IoT (C Project)

**UrbanFlow** is a smart city project built using **C** and **Arduino**, designed to monitor and manage urban infrastructure through IoT devices. This project leverages sensors and microcontrollers to create an intelligent system for smart cities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used:
- **C Programming**
- **Arduino**
- **IoT Sensors**
- **Microcontrollers**
- **Serial Communication**

## üì° Features:
- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Collects data from IoT sensors to monitor parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality.
- **Infrastructure Management**: Helps optimize urban resources like water, electricity, and waste management.
- **Smart Alerts**: Sends alerts to a central system for abnormal conditions (e.g., high pollution, temperature fluctuations).

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use:
1. **Hardware Setup**: Connect the IoT sensors to the Arduino as specified in the project.
2. **Upload Code**: Upload the C code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Data Monitoring**: Use the serial monitor to view the real-time data from the sensors.
4. **Smart City Application**: The data can be used for analysis and management of urban resources.

## üìù Installation:
1. Install the **Arduino IDE**.
2. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
3. Clone this repository and upload the code to the Arduino.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anushka8178/UrbanFlow.git
